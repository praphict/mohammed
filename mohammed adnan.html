  <h1 class="a">history of gaming</h1>       
 <p class="a">The history of video games spans a period of time between the invention of the first electronic games and today, covering a long period of invention and changes. Video gaming reached mainstream popularity in the 1970s and 1980s, when arcade video games, gaming consoles and home computer games were introduced to the general public. Since then, video gaming has become a popular form of entertainment and a part of modern culture in most parts of the world. The early history of video games, therefore, covers the period of time between the first interactive electronic game with an electronic display in 1947, the first true video games in the early 1950s, and the rise of early arcade video games in the 1970s (Pong and the beginning of the first generation of video game consoles with the Magnavox Odyssey, both in 1972). During this time there were a wide range of devices and inventions corresponding with large advances in computing technology, and the actual first video game is dependent on the definition of "video game" used.

Following the 1947 invention of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game as well as the first to use an electronic display, the first true video games were created in the early 1950s. Initially created as technology demonstrations, such as the Bertie the Brain and Nimrod computers in 1950 and 1951, video games also became the purview of academic research. A series of games, generally simulating real-world board games, were created at various research institutions to explore programming, human–computer interaction, and computer algorithms. These include OXO and Christopher Strachey's draughts program in 1952, the first software-based games to incorporate a CRT display, and several chess and checkers programs. Possibly the first video game created simply for entertainment was 1958's Tennis for Two, featuring moving graphics on an oscilloscope. As computing technology improved over time, computers became smaller and faster, and the ability to work on them was opened up to university employees and undergraduate students by the end of the 1950s. These new programmers began to create games for non-academic purposes, leading up to the 1962 release of Spacewar! as one of the earliest known digital computer games to be available outside a single research institute.

Throughout the rest of the 1960s, digital computer games were created by increasingly numerous programmers and sometimes sold commercially in catalogs. As the audience for video games expanded to more than a few dozen research institutions with the falling cost of computers, and programming languages that would run on multiple types of computers were created, a wider variety of games began to be developed. Video games transitioned into a new era in the early 1970s with the launch of the commercial video game industry in 1971 with the display of the coin-operated arcade game Galaxy Game and the release of the first arcade video game Computer Space, and then in 1972 with the release of the immensely successful arcade game Pong and the first home video game console, the Magnavox Odyssey, which launched the first generation of video game consoles.</p>

   <h1 class="a">biggest gaming companies</h1>
   <p class="a">We’re far past the point of pretending that video games aren’t one of the most lucrative businesses in the entertainment industry. Indeed, games like Grand Theft Auto V have eclipsed the sales of many movies and books combined, becoming the highest grossing entertainment product of all time. As time goes on, video games become a larger part of our day to day life, with many who’d never consider themselves gamers playing games on their phone as often as they can. These are the most profitable gaming companies of all time.

<li>Ubisoft

Online shopping for Ubisoft at Amazon.com
Net Worth: $3.69 Billion

With small beginnings in rural France, Yves Guillemot and his four brothers founded Ubisoft in March 1986. Yves still makes an appearance at each E3 conference that Ubisoft holds, and they seem to take pride in the family founded aspect of the company. Although still not breaking the ranks of the kingpins of the western gaming industry such as EA, Microsoft, and Sony, Ubisoft has climbed a long and hard ladder to reach where it is today. Making strategic acquisitions of talented development studios has resulted in Ubisoft cultivating and releasing some of the best known gaming franchises on the market today, such as the Assassin’s Creed series, Watch Dogs, every single Tom Clancy game, including Rainbow Six and The Division as well as buying the South Park IP from the now defunct THQ, which has proved to be a critical darling in the gaming world. Ubisoft has repeatedly carved out their section in the market with strong franchises with iterative sequels that return on investment every single time.

<li>Nintendo

Online shopping for Nintendo at Amazon.com
Net Worth: $20.11 Billion 

Nintendo is one of the most important gaming monikers, not just in today’s market, but in the entire history of the gaming industry. What once began as a card manufacturer in the late 1800s has evolved and adapted to the market today to give us some of the most beloved franchises of all time. After the video game crash of 1982, many believed the short lived art of video games to be dead in the water, but the release of the original Super Mario Bros. on the the original NES single handedly revitalized the entire market. Who knows, if it weren’t for Nintendo, the gaming industry might not be alive today. Over the years they have crafted several well realized worlds such as The Legend of Zelda, Star Fox, and Donkey Kong, as well as the seminal Mario Brothers. They pair their core franchises with innovative consoles such as the Gamecube and the Wii. This tactic has proved to be a high risk, high reward strategy. Although the Wii was the highest selling console of its time, it has since been surpassed and it’s successor, the Wii U has failed to reach its targets by drastic degrees. However, faith is still strong in the company and many believe the long rumored NX will save the company from the brink.

<li>lKing
Amazon Search
Online shopping from a great selection at Apps & Games Store.
Net Worth: $5.69 Billion 

King is the living embodiment of how a one hit wonder can maintain a company for many, many years. King didn’t make mobile games until 2011, and they didn’t encounter much success at that. However, they managed to release Candy Crush Saga at just the right time. A market desire for social integration with mobile games, the simple mechanic of a match three game type, and an addictive leveling system with non-intrusive micro transactions has resulted in a game that is still played by millions on a daily basis. It’s truly terrifying to see how much King has earned off just a single game, but they are living proof that the video game industry is a lucrative one indeed.

<li>Electronic Arts

Online shopping for Electronic Arts at Amazon.com
Net Worth: $22.90 Billion 

EA is one of the oldest independent publishers in the industry that still is relevant to any modern gamer. Founded in 1982, this publisher can take much responsibility for the popularization of the yearly iterative model of games with the annual release cycle of their various sports games such as NBA, FIFA, and NFL, all catering to a certain hardcore audience who’ll buy it every year without fail with minimal additions or modifications to the core mechanics. With such a strong foundation, EA was able to acquisition growing game developers such as DICE in Sweden who makes the Battlefield franchise, now one of the most popular FPS franchises ever made. EA have also partnered with Disney to be the sole distributor of any and all Star Wars games. It doesn’t take a genius to know that Star Wars is one of the entertainment industry’s most lucrative intellectual properties, and every Star Wars game that EA has released so far has been a hit.

<li>Activision Blizzard

Online shopping for Activision at Amazon.com
Net Worth: $29.23 Billion

Out of all the companies I’ve highlighted so far, the partnership between Activision and Blizzard is one of the most interesting. The partnership plays host to the Call of Duty series, Destiny, World of Warcraft, Diablo, and Overwatch. Therefore, if you know your video games, it doesn’t take an expert to conclude that these guys are making some serious bank. You need only look at sales numbers of the recently released Overwatch to know that these guys aren’t going bankrupt any time soon, and with a new Call of Duty coming out every year I imagine we won’t be missing this company for a long time yet.
</li>
<li>2k

Online shopping for 2K Games at Amazon.com
Net Worth: $3.22 Billion

Many would underestimate the power of 2K as a company. Indeed, over the years many have doubted its long term viability due to the departure of Ken Levine from the lauded Irrational Games who made the critically acclaimed Bioshock series. However, what many people forget is that Rockstar Games is under 2K. That’s right, the makers of the Grand Theft Auto series, Red Dead Redemption, Bully, and Max Payne 3. You need only take a light browse through YouTube today to see that Grand Theft Auto V is still incredibly relevant to a modern audience. Add the fact that it is the best selling un-bundled game of all time and the fact that the micro transactions that are a part of the online component of GTA V are still selling by the boatloads almost three years from its original release date and the statistics will tell you everything you need to know about the financial viability of 2K. Gearbox Software, developer of  the remarkably successful Borderlands franchise, is also under 2K. I think it’s a safe bet that the records they’ve set already are ready and waiting to be broken.
</li>
<li>Microsoft

Online shopping for Microsoft at Amazon.com
Net Worth: $402.06 Billion

I don’t need to explain who Microsoft is to anyone using a computer. Perhaps one of the most successful companies in the past 30 years, Microsoft is doing their damnedest to dominate your living room, and that includes your video game console. Upon the release of the Xbox in the early 2000s, the Playstation and the Gamecube suddenly had unanticipated competition. Although initially dismissed by many, the invention of Xbox Live and the domination of the core gamer market from 2008-2013 has made Microsoft a force to be reckoned with.
</li>

<li>Sony

Online shopping for Sony at Amazon.com
Net Worth: $37.45 Billion

But Sony is their main competitor. Their product, the Playstation, initially a direct competitor to to the N64 from Nintendo, has persevered through the prosperous PS2 period and the tumultuous PS3 period to enter a new golden age with the ridiculously lucrative PS4. With a wide branch of first party games under its belt, Sony has now committed to a consumer friendly approach to all aspects of their video game branch. With Sony TVs falling off the map in recent years, a renewed and fresh emphasis on the PS4 has launched it into commercial heaven.
</li>
<li>Tencent

Online shopping for Tencent at Amazon.com
Net Worth: $197.4 Billion

I didn’t know who they were either, that is, until you look into what game they support. None other than League of Legends, the most successful MOBA to arrive on the gaming market. Although many predict that the MOBA bubble has well and truly popped, League of Legends has persevered, consistently staying at the top of the most streamed games on twitch. With micro transactions galore and a ravenous fanbase eager for more content, League of Legends is, in my opinion, the biggest sleeper hit ever to hit the gaming market.
